# ResUNet++

This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of **ResUNet++**, a powerful architecture for semantic segmentation that combines residual blocks, squeeze-and-excitation modules, and atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP).

## ðŸ“Œ Features

* **Residual Connections** for better gradient flow
* **SE Blocks** for channel-wise attention
* **ASPP Module** for multi-scale context
* **Deep Supervision Ready**
